  <h3>Why is the topic of Human Rights still relevent today? </h3>

      <li>Inequality and Discrimination: Inequality and discrimination persist in many societies, affecting marginalized and vulnerable groups disproportionately. Addressing</li>
      <li>Armed Conflicts and Refugee Crises: Armed conflicts, violence, and persecution force millions of people to flee their homes and seek refuge elsewhere. Refugee crises highlight the importance of protecting the rights of refugees and migrants, ensuring their safety, dignity, and access to essential services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why should we fights for Human Rights? </h3>
    <p>People should fight for others' human rights for several compelling reasons:
      <ul>
        <li>Inherent Dignity: Human rights are grounded in the inherent dignity and worth of every individual. Upholding these rights ensures that everyone is treated with respect and fairness, regardless of their background, identity, or circumstances.</li>
        <li>Promotion of Justice: Protecting human rights promotes justice and equality within societies. It helps to address systemic inequalities and discrimination, creating a more just and equitable world for all.
</li>
        <li>Prevention of Suffering: Human rights violations often lead to suffering, oppression, and injustice for individuals and communities. By advocating for human rights, people can help prevent or alleviate this suffering and promote well-being.</li>
        <li>Fulfillment of Basic Needs: Human rights encompass essential needs such as food, shelter, education, healthcare, and freedom from violence. Ensuring these rights are respected and upheld enables individuals to live with dignity and reach their full potential.</li>
        <li>Protection of Vulnerable Groups: Many human rights violations disproportionately affect vulnerable and marginalized groups, including women, children, refugees, ethnic minorities, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Advocating for their rights helps to protect these groups from discrimination, violence, and exploitation.</li>
